Foundations of Computer Science 💻 This section covers the fundamental concepts of computer science, including hardware architecture, operating systems, and the underlying principles of computing.

Key Topics 📚 Introduction to Computer Systems 🖥️

Understanding how computers work: Hardware + Software Overview of input/output devices, CPU, memory, storage, and more Computer Architecture 🏗️

Structure of a computer: Central Processing Unit (CPU), Memory, Storage Basic components: ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit), Control Unit, Registers Memory Hierarchy: RAM, Cache, Disk Storage Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) Operating Systems Basics 📂

Definition and role of an OS in managing hardware and software resources Key functions of an OS: Process Management, Memory Management, File System, Device Management Types of Operating Systems: Batch, Time-Sharing, Real-Time, Networked Processes and Threads 🧵

What is a process? A running instance of a program Thread vs. Process: Differences and how they interact Process Scheduling and CPU scheduling algorithms (FCFS, Round Robin, etc.) Memory Management 📊

Virtual Memory vs. Physical Memory Paging, Segmentation, and Memory Allocation techniques Role of Cache Memory File Systems 🗂️

How data is stored and organized on disk File system structures: Directories, Files, Metadata File access methods: Sequential, Random Input/Output Systems 🔌

How computers interact with external devices I/O devices: Keyboard, Mouse, Monitor, Printers, etc. I/O buffering, Interrupts, and Polling Computer Networks 🌐

Basics of data communication and networking OSI Model, TCP/IP, Network protocols, Sockets
